    <p><i><b>The modernization of Indian fighter jets has become complicated due to American F-35 availability and Russian Su-57 production offers to the Indian market.</b></i></p>

    <p><img src="flashPoint3.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="Su-57 Fighter Jet"></p>
    
    <p><i><b>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Trump held a joint press conference at the White House after holding bilateral talks.</b></i></p>
    
    <p>President Donald Trump disclosed on Thursday that the United States would supply F-35 stealth fighter jets to India thus bestowing upon the country membership among select nations with cutting-edge stealth aircraft.</p>

    <p>Military product sales to India will experience substantial increases worth billions of dollars starting from this year. The United States intends to give India the F-35 stealth fighter jets according to Trump who announced this truth alongside Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their press conference at the White House.</p>

    <p>The announcement happens at a time when Beijing under communist leader Xi Jinping becomes more assertive in Indo-Pacific affairs as Pakistan relies increasingly on Chinese “iron brother” support. During recent times China presented its newest stealth fighter jet while Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari travelled to Beijing to strengthen bilateral relations.</p>
    
    <p>In November 2024 at the Airshow China event in Zhuhai Guangdong Province China displayed a groundbreaking scaled-down version of their J-20S stealth fighter jet for the first time at the world's level.</p>

    <p><i><b>China unveiled its secretive J-20 stealth fighter at the air show in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, Reuters</b></i></p>
    
    <h4><b>Strategic or trade motivated?</b></h4>
    
    <p>The motivation behind the agreement remains unknown. The transaction may either address India's expanding trade deficit with the United States given upcoming reciprocal tariffs or establish new strategic military partnerships. The discussions held between the two sides during the meeting remain undisclosed. The pace of rapid <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-india/#:~:text=India%20also%20participates%20in%20the,and%20secure%20Indo%2DPacific%20region." target="blank">Indo-US defence relations</a> development becomes increasingly apparent.</p>
    
    <h4><b>Russia’s offers Su-57 for India</b></h4>
    
    <p>Russian officials submitted a proposal to India on February 12, 2025, for producing the Sukhoi Su-57 fighter jet to supply the Indian Air Force. Two officials from Russia and India both confirmed this offer because Moscow seeks to advance its defence relations with Delhi.</p>
    
    <p><img src="flashPoint6.png" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="Su-57 at Zhuhai Airshow"></p>
    
    <p><b><i>The Sukhoi Su-57 is a stealth, single-seat, twin-engine multirole fifth-generation jet fighter being developed since 2002 for air superiority and attack operations.</i></b></p>
     
    <p>Over the years Russia has supplied India with most of its military weapons which together form a significant part of the Indian armed forces. Moscow faces difficulties in weapon exports because of the Ukraine conflict resulting in India's evaluation of Western defence systems.</p>

    <p><a href="https://indianembassy-moscow.gov.in/india-russia-defence-cooperation.php" target="_blank">The Russian state arms exporter “Rosoboronexport” has declared that this year could begin Su-57 production in India provided New Delhi accepts the offer. The complete technology transfer would enable Russian industries to maintain and produce their items without interruption despite Western sanctions imposed on Russia</a></p>

    <p>Production of the Su-57 began in 2022 even though this aircraft serves as Russia's advanced stealth fighter program. Also, the development process and an aircraft accident in 2019 caused delays within the production timeline.</p>


    <p>The Su-57 made its debut at the <mark>Zhuhai international air show</mark> when Russia sent it to China for the first time indicating strengthening defence relations between the countries.</p>

    <h4><b>Aero India 2025: A historic display</b></h4>

    <p>Aero India 2025 brought together the world's two leading fifth-generation stealth fighter jet aircraft when it displayed the Russian Su-57 and American Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.</p>

    <p>Comparison between Russian Su‑57 and the US F‑35:
      <a href="https://militarywatchmagazine.com/articles/2019/05/08/article_5cd2d3870ee635_05206545.pdf">Su-57 vs F-35</a>
    </p>

    <p>History records this as the first occasion two premier fifth-generation fighter jets engaged in the worldwide aviation exhibition.</p>

    <p>On the first day of the five-day exhibition both aircraft flew to display their combat abilities and agility for spectators present at the event. According to airshow observers the takes-off with short runways combined with agile flight capabilities of the Su-57 stole the highlight. During its flight demonstration the F-35 displayed quick acceleration together with remarkable handling abilities.</p>

    <h4><b>India’s growing role in global defence cooperation</b></h4>
    <p>The Russian defence ministry views the Su-57 as their leading stealth multi-role fighter because it provides air dominance together with offensive attack systems. The advanced avionics along with super cruise capability and stealth technology features make the aircraft appear at Aero India 2025. Aero India 2025 guests will witness high-speed flight shows together with operational demonstrations which emphasize the fighter aircraft's combat-ready features including manoeuvrability alongside stealth capabilities and firing capacity according to the ministry statement.</p>

    <p>Lockheed Martin develops the F-35 Lightning II fighter jet as:</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p>"The fifth-generation fighter jet that delivers stealth technology alongside top-notch situational awareness and networked combat capabilities."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The inclusion of both aircraft in Aero India 2025 highlights India’s strategic importance as a global hub for defence and aerospace collaboration.</p>

    <h4><b>India’s air force modernisation</b></h4>
    <p>The Indian Air Force strives to enhance its fighter squadrons as China extends its air force capabilities while squadron numbers remain at 31 well behind the established target of 42. India has become a crucial force in international military planning as shown by the aggressive competition between Russia and the US to gain Indian defence contracts.</p>

    <p>The proposed F-35 sale enables Trump to gain trade benefits while serving as a defensive strategy for Modi as Pakistan aligns with China</p>

    <p><b>Meta Description:</b></p>
    <p>The F-35 sale to India would enhance bilateral defence relations between the U.S. and India while supporting Trump's trading agenda and bolstering Modi's military posture against growing Pakistan-China cooperation.</p>
