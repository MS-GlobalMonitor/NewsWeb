    <h4>Why did the Air India 787 crash kill people so badly- was it the pilot mistake or a cover up like the Boeing 737 Max? This is what the investigation shows.</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>On the 12 th of June in 2025 there happened to be an <strong>Air India Flight 171</strong> plane crash, which was a <strong>Boeing 787 8 Dreamliner</strong> taking off at Ahmedabad Airport, 
        India. With 230 passengers and 12 members of the crew, the flight commanding a total of 242 people. The flight was headed to London gatwick. 
        It was one of the deadliest air crashes ever to have happened and as of late the accident took away the lives of 241 people only leaving one survivor and some on the ground. 
        Following the aftermath, people have raised questions on whether the accident was because of 
        <strong><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/boeing-737-max-the-troubled-history-of-fatal-crashes-and-346-deaths-in-7-years/articleshow/111566888.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank">pilot error or a cover up job as in the case of the Boeing 737 max accidents</a></strong>. 
        In the attempt to answer these questions this article examines preliminary investigation report and media coverage of the same as well as the discourse in the society using information that was available up to July 12, 2025.

    <h5>Crash Details</h5>

     <p>The flight Air India 171 got its way off the ground at <mark>13:39 IST (08:09 UTC) on June 12, 2025, in Ahmedabad Airport</mark>. In less than 30 seconds after the onset of "lighten-up" the airplane entered a <mark>descending flight path with wings-level, nose-up attitude. 
        The plane lost the power and thrust and issued the mayday call but crashed into the hostel block of B. J. medical college, Ahmedabad</mark>. The effects led to several explosions killing 19 people on ground and injuring 67 others. The <mark>only survival was of a passenger sitting in the 11A, the vicinity of an emergency exit. 
        The airline, with the registration number VT-ANB, was a Boeing 787 8 Dreamliner</mark> and it has been highly advanced, regarding the technology and safety until this accident.

   <h5>Preliminary Investigation Findings</h5>

   <p>This is the preliminary report that <mark>Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB)</mark> 
    of India released on July 8, 2025, which sheds important light on the cause of the crash. The most important findings can be outlined as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Engine Thrust Loss:</strong> The fuel control switches on both engines were switched to <mark>CUTOFF</mark> position one second apart, at the second <b>(08:08:42 UTC)</b> after takeoff speed <b>(08:08:33 UTC) and lift off (08:08:39 UTC)</b>.</li>
      <li><strong>Cockpit Voice Recordings:</strong> The recordings showed how one of the pilots asked why the fuel was turned off, and the other pilot denies involvement implying that something happened accidentally.</li>
      <li><strong>Flight Data:</strong><mark><a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/Pages/cvr_fdr.aspx" target="_blank">Flight data record (FDR), cockpit voice data recorder (CVR)</a></mark>, commonly referred to as the <mark>black boxes</mark>, <b>displayed that at 08:08:47 UTC</b>, the <mark> <a href="https://skybrary.aero/articles/ram-air-turbine-rat" target="_blank">Ram air turbine (RAT)</a></mark> was deployed to provide emergency power.

  <p>In its conclusion, the report believes that the cause of the fuel switch movements is still under investigation, but it tends to be an operational error due to lack of mechanical problems and the confusion that pilots at the time recorded in the report.</p>

    <h5>Pilot Error Analysis</h5>
    <p>Its pilots comprised the Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and Co-pilot Clive Kundar who are quite experienced. The total flight experience of Captain Sabharwal was 15 638 hours and 8 596 hours on Boeing 787 
        whereas Co-pilot Kundar had 3 403 flight experience with 1 128 time on the 787 aircraft. Both had been allowed ample rest and were both passed through preflight Breath Analyzer. 
        The Pilot Flying (PF) was the co-pilot, and the Pilot Monitoring (PM) was the captain. 
        The cockpit voice recordings reveal they were surprised and confused when the fuel has been shut off as one of the pilots asks what was happening as another one states that it was not his/her fault. 
        This is an indication of unintentional shifting of the fuel control switches as opposed to intentional action which indicates probable operation error.

    <h5>Cover-Up Allegations</h5>
    <h6>Cover Up Charges</h6>
    
    <p>There is speculation of cover-up, a parallel to the crash of Boeing 737 Max, especially on social media. In 2018 and 2019 737 Max episodes included a faulty MCAS system and accusations that Boeing was hiding flaws in design, resulting in a worldwide grounding of the plane. 
        Comparatively, no evidence of the systemic problems can be found in the case of the Air India 787 crash. A multi-nation investigation process by international agencies such as the U.S National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Boeing, GE, FAA, AAIB-UK, GPIAAF-Portugal, and TSB-Canada is underway thorough ICAO guidelines.
        There have been arguments over the move to possibly ship the black boxes to the U.S. to be analysed with some social media posts including those of @OpIndia_com on June 19, 2025, citing conflict of interest since both Boeing and GE have a homeland in the U.S. The Ministry of Civil Aviation however explained that this was a technical as well as security decision and it was not an effort to conceal information. 
        The laboratory of the AAIB in India would be able to perform such analysis, although the international cooperation is the norm in such a case of massive incidents. The rest of them some of which include a post-dated July 1, 2025, by @pbhushan1 suggested government cover-up but this is not cemented by credible sources in the form of government or reputable newspaper house such as the BBC, reuters, and the New York times.

    </p>

    <h5>Comparison with Boeing 737 max Incidents</h5> 
    <p>
        The two crashes reported in the Boeing 737 Max were associated with inherent weaknesses in the design of the MCAS system, whereby there have been suggestions that Boeing may have been withholding vital information to regulators and pilots. 
        The Air India 787 crash however seems to be an isolated operational mistake. As of June 18, 2025, Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which started service in 2011, was in 1,200 aircraft in service globally with no history of fatal accident. Unlike with the 737 Max, 
        the 787 does not indicate to the presence of manufacturer misdoings or design flaws.
    </p>

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>
        With the early report and the information that is currently available, it appears very possible that the cause of the Air India Boeing 787 accident may have been that the fuel control switches were shifted to CUTOFF position, which again could have been caused by the mistake of the pilot or an unintentional action of the pilot. 
        No reasonable data can prove that an attempt to cover up is present, as it was the case with the Boeing 737 Max saga. The investigation, including international cooperation, seems transparent, and the concluding report, which can be expected in 12 months, 
        can shed some more light. By July 12, 2025, the reality seems to be an operational error and not system malfunction or dishonest behavior, which may provide some insights to the families of the deceased and readers trying to find the explanation to such a traumatic experience as this one.
